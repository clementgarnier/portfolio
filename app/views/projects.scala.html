            In charge of the front-end of our web application (<strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Backbone.js</strong>), I have been also involved in back-end development (<strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Play&nbsp;2</strong>). As a very early employee of this start-up, I contributed to the design of the product and the technical decisions we have made.

            For the purpose of an academic project at UQAM, I have developed this social recommendation engine allowing people to interact (like, dislike, commentâ€¦) with local venues such as restaurants, businesses and monuments. Users log in with <strong>Facebook connect</strong> and find venues through the <strong>Foursquare API</strong>. The application uses <strong>Neo4j</strong> along with a Scala Neo4j wrapper to store everything as a graph.

            This French cosmetics company needed a simple web application enabling their customers to compose their own serums, based on their skin problems. I designed and developed a rich web application using <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong> on the front-end, as well as an API written with <strong>Symfony 2</strong>.

            For the needs of a photography foundation based in New York, I developed this web application allowing photographers to upload then manage geolocated pictures. I also built an API for browsing the content through an iPad application, developed separately. This project uses <strong>Play&nbsp;2</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, including GridFS storage features and geospatial indexing.

            <p class="project-description">
            Moving its digital signage offer to the cloud, Linutop needed a web console to control remote screens, i.e. define which media are played, and when. This console, developed using <strong>Backbone.js</strong>, manages a library of files, a bunch of ordered playlists, and includes an HTML editor to edit web pages on the fly.

            When launching this development studio called Welite, we wanted an appealing website explaining what we do. I shipped this single page in a few hours, including design and wording. More than two years after, it still does the job.
