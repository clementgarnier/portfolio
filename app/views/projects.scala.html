            In charge of the front-end of our web application (<strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Backbone.js</strong>), I was also involved in back-end development (<strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Play&nbsp;2</strong>). As the first employee of this start-up, I contributed to the design of the product and the various technical decisions we have made.

            For the purpose of an academic project at UQAM, I have developed this social recommandation service allowing people to interact (like, dislike, commentâ€¦) with local venues such as restaurants, museums and monuments. Users log in with <strong>Facebook connect</strong> and find venues through the <strong>Foursquare API</strong>. Users, venues and interactions are stored as a graph running on <strong>Neo4j</strong>.

            This French cosmetic company needed a simple web application to compose custom serums. I designed and developed a rich web application using <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong> on the front-end, as well as an API written with <strong>Symfony 2</strong>.

            For the needs of a photography foundation based in New York, I developed this web application allowing photographers to upload geolocated pictures. I also built an API for browsing the content through an iPad application, developed separately. This project uses <strong>Play&nbsp;2</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, including GridFS storage features and geospatial indexing.

            <p class="project-description">
            Moving its digital signage offer to the cloud, Linutop needed a web console to control remote screens, i.e. define which media are played, and when. This console, developed using <strong>Backbone.js</strong>, manages a library of files, a bunch of ordered playlists, and includes a HTML editor to edit web pages on the fly.

            When launching this development studio called Welite, we wanted a simple website explaining what we do. I shipped this single page in a few hours, including design and wording. More than two years after, it still does the job.
