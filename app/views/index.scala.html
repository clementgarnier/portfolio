            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                After finishing a Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.uqam.ca/">University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM)</a>, having spent the last four years studying Computer Engineering in Paris & San Jose, I am currently working as a back-end software developer at <a href="http://www.wajam.com/">Wajam</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides university, I have contributed to various web projects over the last few years. As I enjoy doing both front-end and back-end development, I have often worked across the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
            More recently, I had fun working with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/"><strong>Scala</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.playframework.org/"><strong>Play! Framework</strong></a>, along with trendy NoSQL technology such as <a href="http://redis.io/"><strong>Redis</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/"><strong>MongoDB</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/"><strong>Neo4j</strong></a>.                    
            </p>
